# 🌸 Iris Classification & Visualization Project

This repository contains a Python-based Iris dataset classification and visualization assignment. It includes four main tasks that range from basic 2D decision-boundary visualizations to interactive 3D charts and dynamic slicing animations.

## 📂 Project Structure

The repository contains the following key scripts and output files:

| Filename | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `task1.py` | 2D classifier comparison: compare decision boundaries of different classifiers on a 2D plane (Sepal Length vs Sepal Width). |
| `task2.py` | 3D linear decision boundaries: generate an interactive 3D chart with Plotly showing multinomial logistic regression decision planes in 3D feature space. |
| `task3.py` | 3D non-linear decision surface: use SVM (RBF kernel) to classify Setosa vs Virginica and plot a 3D probability-difference surface. |
| `task4.py` | 3D decision-boundary slicing animation: create an animated GIF that shows how 2D decision boundaries change as the third feature (Petal Length) varies. |
| `iris_3d_boundary.html` | Interactive 3D visualization webpage generated by `task2.py`. |
| `task4_iris_3d_slicing.gif` | Animated slicing GIF produced by `task4.py`. |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repository

First, clone the project locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ruihaoGitHub/Iris_Classification.git
cd Iris_Classification
```

### 2. Environment setup

- **Python version**: 3.10+

Make sure the required Python packages are installed. You can use the provided `requirements.txt` to install them:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the tasks

#### 1. Run Task 1 (2D classifier comparison)
This script displays the classification results of different models over a 2D feature plane.
```bash
python task1.py
```

#### 2. Run Task 2 (Interactive 3D chart)
This script generates `iris_3d_boundary.html`; open it in your browser to interact with the 3D decision boundaries.
```bash
python task2.py
```

#### 3. Run Task 3 (SVM 3D surface)
This script opens a window to visualize the SVM RBF probability surface in 3D.
```bash
python task3.py
```

#### 4. Run Task 4 (Slicing animation)
This script generates the `task4_iris_3d_slicing.gif` animation showing the dynamic change of decision boundaries.
```bash
python task4.py
```

## 📊 Task Details

### Task 1: 2D Classifier Comparison
- **Features**: Sepal Length, Sepal Width
- **Models**:
  - Logistic Regression (RBF features)
  - Gradient Boosting
  - Logistic Regression (Binned features)
  - Logistic Regression (Spline features)
- **Output**: Matplotlib static plots showing the decision regions produced by each model.

### Task 2: 3D Linear Decision Boundaries
- **Features**: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length
- **Model**: Multinomial Logistic Regression
- **Visualization**: Built with Plotly; supports rotation and zoom. Shows linear separating planes between the three classes.

### Task 3: 3D Non-linear Decision Surface
- **Features**: Sepal Length, Petal Length
- **Classes**: Setosa vs Virginica
- **Model**: SVM with RBF kernel
- **Visualization**: 3D surface where the height represents the probability difference (P(Virginica) - P(Setosa)), illustrating the non-linear decision boundary.

### Task 4: 3D Decision Boundary Slicing
- **Features**: Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length (used as the slicing axis)
- **Visualization**: Animated GIF. Fix a series of values for the third feature (Petal Length) and observe how the decision boundaries on the first two-feature plane change, which helps understand model behavior in higher dimensions.
